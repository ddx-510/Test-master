# Graph revision

## Basics

Graph consists of
- nodes/ vertices (V)
- edges (E)

### Types of graph
- hypergraph: each edge connects >= 2 nodes, each edge is unique. Contains at least one node.
- multigraph: Contains at least one node, each edge connects two nodes, two nodes may be connected by more than one edge

Graph G = <V,E>

### Terminology

Degree of a node : number of adjacent edges.

Degree of a graph : max number of adjacent edges.

Diameter: max distance between two ndoes, following the shortest path

### Special graph

|          | Star | Clique/Complete Graph | Line/Path | Cycle        | Bipartite Graph |
| -------- | ---- |:---------------------:| --------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Diameter | 2    |           1           | n-1       | n/2 or n/2-1 | Max: n-1        |
| Degree   | n-1  |          n-1          | 2         | 2            | 2               |

#### Bipartite Graph
Nodes divided into two sets, with no edges between nodes in the same set.

Max diameter: n-1
In cycle, count no of nodes -> even yes, odd not a bipartite

## Representing a graph

### Adjacency List
Graph consists of nodes + edges

- Nodes: stored in an array
- Edges: linked list per node

### Adjacency Matrix
- Nodes
- Edges: pairs of nodes

**A[v][w] = 1 iff (v,w) subset of E**
**A^2 = length 2 paths**

### Adj List VS Adj Matrix

**Using Adj List:**

for a graph G = (V,E)
- array of size V
- linked list of size E
- total: O(V + E)
- cycle: O(V)
- clique: O(V^2)

**Using Adj Matrix:**
- array of size V^2
- total: O(V^2)
- cycle: O(V^2)
- clique: O(V^2)

Rule: If the graph is **dense**, using adjacent matrix or else use adjacent list

dense: E = theta(V^2)

- What is the worst time complexity of checking node u and v are directly connected by an edge in a graph G = |V, E| when adjacency list is used:
    -  **O(min(V, E))**

|            |                    Adjacency Matrix                     | Adjacency List                                     |
| ---------- |:-------------------------------------------------------:| -------------------------------------------------- |
| fast query |                   are v,w neighbours                    | find me any neighbours && enumerate all neighbours |
| slow query | find me any neighbour of v &&  enumerate all neighbours | are v,w neighbours                                 |

## Searhcing a graph

### Breadth-first search
#### Concept
- Explore level by level
- Frontier: current level
- Initially: {S}
- Advance Frontier
- Dont backtrack
- Find sahortest path

#### Code implementation
- Build levels
- Calculate `level[i]` from `level[i-1]`
- Skip visited nodes

```java
BFS(Node[] nodeList, int startId) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[nodeList.length];
    Arrays.fill(visited, false);
    int[] parent = new int[nodelist.length];
    Arrays.fill(parent, -1);

    for (int start = 0; start < nodeList.length; start++) {
        if (!visited[start]){
            // Main code goes here!
            Collection<Integer> frontier = new Collection<Integer>;
            frontier.add(startId);

            while (!frontier.isEmpty()){
                Collection<Integer> nextFrontier = new â€¦ ;
                for (Integer v : frontier) {
                    for (Integer w : nodeList[v].nbrList) {
                        if (!visited[w]) {
                            visited[w] = true;
                            parent[w] = v;
                            nextFrontier.add(w);
                        }
                    }
                }
                frontier = nextFrontier;
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Analysis
> When does BFS failed to visit every node?
- when the graph has two components

> Running time using adjacency List: **O(V+E)**
- Vertex v = "start" once ==> O(V)
- Vertex v add to nextFrontier once ==> O(V)
    - after added never re-added
- Each v.nbrList is enumerated once. ==> O(E)
    - when v is removed from frontier

- BFS always run in O(V^2) on a complete graph as O(V+E) --> O(V^2) in a clique
> using an adjacency matrix: **O(|V|^2)**

#### Shortest Path
- Parent pointers store the shortest path
- Shortest path is a tree
- (Possibly high degrees; possibly high diameter)

#### Applications
> [Source of applications](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/breadth-first-search.html#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20how,is%20the%20number%20of%20edges.)
- Find the shortest path from a source to other vertices in an unweighted graph.

- Find all connected components in an undirected graph in O(n+m) time: To do this, we just run BFS starting from each vertex, except for vertices which have already been visited from previous runs. Thus, we perform normal BFS from each of the vertices, but do not reset the array used[] each and every time we get a new connected component, and the total running time will still be O(n+m) (performing multiple BFS on the graph without zeroing the array used[] is called a series of breadth first searches).

- Finding a solution to a problem or a game with the least number of moves, if each state of the game can be represented by a vertex of the graph, and the transitions from one state to the other are the edges of the graph.

- Finding the shortest path in a graph with weights 0 or 1: This requires just a little modification to normal breadth-first search: Instead of maintaining array used[], we will now check if the distance to vertex is shorter than current found distance, then if the current edge is of zero weight, we add it to the front of the queue else we add it to the back of the queue.This modification is explained in more detail in the article 0-1 BFS.

- Finding the shortest cycle in a directed unweighted graph: Start a breadth-first search from each vertex. As soon as we try to go from the current vertex back to the source vertex, we have found the shortest cycle containing the source vertex. At this point we can stop the BFS, and start a new BFS from the next vertex. From all such cycles (at most one from each BFS) choose the shortest.

- Find all the edges that lie on any shortest path between a given pair of vertices (a,b). To do this, run two breadth first searches: one from a and one from b. Let da[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the first BFS (from a) and db[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the second BFS from b. Now for every edge (u,v) it is easy to check whether that edge lies on any shortest path between a and b: the criterion is the condition da[u]+1+db[v]=da[b].

- Find all the vertices on any shortest path between a given pair of vertices (a,b). To accomplish that, run two breadth first searches: one from a and one from b. Let da[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the first BFS (from a) and db[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the second BFS (from b). Now for each vertex it is easy to check whether it lies on any shortest path between a and b: the criterion is the condition da[v]+db[v]=da[b].

- Find the shortest path of even length from a source vertex s to a target vertex t in an unweighted graph: For this, we must construct an auxiliary graph, whose vertices are the state (v,c), where v - the current node, c=0 or c=1 - the current parity. Any edge (a,b) of the original graph in this new column will turn into two edges ((u,0),(v,1)) and ((u,1),(v,0)). After that we run a BFS to find the shortest path from the starting vertex (s,0) to the end vertex (t,0).
